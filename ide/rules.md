# RULES
if anything is added is added its a new version ex 1.0.0->1.0.1
most changes that breaks something gets a new version,ex 1.0.0->1.1.0, if everything works the same (ill prob make a benchmark script or sum) no new version
major changes also get a new edition, ex 1.0.0 ->2.0.0
(also always update them to the newest psy languages which count as an update, ex 1.0.0->1.0.1 if its apart of another change dont add another update the the counter)
# locations
in each version there should be imports (shouldnt be too hard to maintain for most updates plus could prob make a script to check which ones work(the benchmark))
in each version there should be code (duh) add asmuch as you need, ideally its 1 file but eh
